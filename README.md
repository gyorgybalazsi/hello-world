# hello-world

Deleted the original first line.

This is my edig to see how Github handles a branch and its edits.

Let's see another branch and PR to the README file. So this is my edit in the main branch.

Now I add a line to the readme file locally.

And also I deleted the last line of the previous commit.

This is the second local edit.

This is also an edit to the readme file.
